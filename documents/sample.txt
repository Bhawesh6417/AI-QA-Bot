New Delhi: In candid assessment of India’s Operation Sindoor, Lieutenant General Rahul R. Singh, Deputy Chief of Army Staff (Capability Development & Sustenance), has said that there are multiple lessons to be learnt from the 87-hour conflict, with the biggest lesson being that while there was just one border, there were a minimum of three adversaries.

Speaking Friday at an event  ‘New Age Military Technologies’ organised by FICCI, Lt Gen Singh said, “First, one border, two adversaries. So, we saw Pakistan on one side, but adversaries were two, actually four, or let’s say three.”

Further explaining his statement, he added, “Pakistan was the front face. We had China providing all possible support. This is no surprise because if you look at statistics, in the last five years, 81 percent of the military hardware that Pakistan is getting is all Chinese. China, of course, the good old dictum, killed by a borrowed knife…So, he would rather use the neighbour to cause pain than get involved in the mud-slinging match on the northern borders.”

China has been able to test its weapons against others, he said. “So, it’s like a live lab available to them. It is something that we have to be very cognizant about. Turkey also played an important role in providing the type of support it did…” he said on the use of Turkish drones of various kinds by the Pakistani military.
